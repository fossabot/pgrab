PGrab is a banner grabber tool used to gather information about a remote server or device, specifically the banner or header information that is sent when a connection is made.

## Installation Through PIP
To install dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation with Docker
This tool can also be used with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). To set up the Docker environment, follow these steps (trying using with sudo, if you get any error):

```bash
docker build -t pgrab:latest .
```

# Using the PGrab
To run the PGrab on a domain or IP, provide the domain/IP as an argument with the flag -p to give port number:
```bash
python main.py example.com -p 80 --path /
```

For an overview of all commands use the following command:

```bash
python3 pgrab.py -h
```

The output shown below are the latest supported commands.

```bash
usage: python main.py [-h] -p PORT [--path PATH] [-o file_path] [-v] ip/hostname

**NOTE:** Banner grabbing can be used for legitimate purposes, such as network auditing and security testing, but can also be used for malicious purposes, so use this script responsibly and with permission from the target owner.

**TODO:**
  * Add support for other protocols such as:
    * https (443)
    * dns (53)
    * many more...
